To edit this table you need to open the attribute table, switch on Edition mode and add a new row. Switching to edit mode: Adding a new row: Switching to the form view: You can access the form view in the bottom right corner of the attribute table. On the Theme table you can add many theme corresponding to different theme of your layers. You need to enter a code e.g. \"A01\", and a label corresponding at the name e.g. \"Naturals area\". Example adding theme: On the Contact table you can add contacts that can later be associated with your metadata layer. Example new contact: The Dataset table is the metadata table. You can add many rows and one added line corresponds to a metadata of a layer. You need to fill a row with these minimum information : Table name, Schema name, Title, Abstract, Etc Example to add a new metadata for a layer: On the second picture you can see the theme. Now you can add a contact to a dataset row with the Dataset table. You can click on a tab called contact . You need to allow edit mode in this tab because you implement another table. Example: You can add some Link to a dataset row with the Dataset table. It's same that to add a contact, you have a link tab. Don't forget to allow edit mode . Example: When you stop editing a table, don't forget to save your change with clicking on the save icon et leave the edit mode. To save: To leave the edit mode you need to click on the same button that to enter the edit mode. HTML Template # You can customize the HTML template.

Example adding theme: On the Contact table you can add contacts that can later be associated with your metadata layer. Example new contact: The Dataset table is the metadata table. You can add many rows and one added line corresponds to a metadata of a layer. You need to fill a row with these minimum information : Table name, Schema name, Title, Abstract, Etc Example to add a new metadata for a layer: On the second picture you can see the theme. Now you can add a contact to a dataset row with the Dataset table. You can click on a tab called contact . You need to allow edit mode in this tab because you implement another table. Example: You can add some Link to a dataset row with the Dataset table. It's same that to add a contact, you have a link tab. Don't forget to allow edit mode . Example: When you stop editing a table, don't forget to save your change with clicking on the save icon et leave the edit mode. To save: To leave the edit mode you need to click on the same button that to enter the edit mode.","title":"Editing metadata"},{"location":"user-guide/gis-admin/#html-template","text":"You can customize the HTML template.
