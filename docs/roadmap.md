# Roadmap

We have a few ideas how we can improve PgMetadata :

* Export to spreadsheet format
* Inspire
* Translation
* Support remote database
* More integration with the
  [QGIS native metadata editor](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/vector_properties.html?highlight=metadata#metadata-properties)

Feel free to [contact us by mail](https://www.3liz.com/contacts.html) or discussion the GitHub
[issue tracker](https://github.com/3liz/qgis-pgmetadata-plugin/issues).
