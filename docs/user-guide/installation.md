# Installation

The plugin is not yet available in the official QGIS repository, you must install it manually.

## Custom repository

We recommend adding the QGIS [custom repository](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/plugins/plugins.html#the-settings-tab),
using this URL `https://github.com/3liz/qgis-pgmetadata-plugin/releases/latest/download/plugins.xml`.
There isn't any authentification, and you will have automatic updates later.

## Manual ZIP

If you don't want to set up a custom repository, you can download the ZIP file from the
[release page](https://github.com/3liz/qgis-pgmetadata-plugin/releases)
